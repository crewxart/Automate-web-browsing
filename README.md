# Automate web browsing
 A simple web browsing with Selenium.

 What's automate web browsing?
 - Test website functionality
 - Botting Processes online

In this project, I developed an python code that navigate in starken website and check the status of an order.
This return the status of the order.

First of all, I installed Selenium library.
- pip install selenium #Selenium can use to automate web processes.

Then, I used Chrome driver.
- pip install chromedriver
